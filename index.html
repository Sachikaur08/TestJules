                    <h3>Introduction to Electrostatics</h3>
                    <p>Electrostatics is the study of electric charges at rest. It deals with the phenomena and properties of stationary or slow-moving electric charges with no acceleration. The term "electrostatics" comes from the Greek word "elektron," which means "amber," and "statikos," which means "standing" or "at rest."</p>
                    <p>In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of electric charge, Coulomb's law, electric field, electric potential, and capacitance. We will also discuss the behavior of conductors and insulators in electric fields.</p>

                    <h3>Coulomb's Law</h3>
                    <p>Coulomb's Law states that the force of attraction or repulsion between two stationary electric charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force acts along the straight line joining the two charges.</p>
                    <p>Mathematically, Coulomb's Law can be expressed as:</p>
                    <p>F = k * |q1*q2| / r^2</p>
                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>F is the electrostatic force between the two charges.</li>
                        <li>k is Coulomb's constant (8.987 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2).</li>
                        <li>q1 and q2 are the magnitudes of the two charges.</li>
                        <li>r is the distance between the two charges.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electric charge is quantized, meaning it exists in discrete units.</li>
                    <li>Like charges repel, and opposite charges attract.</li>
                    <li>Coulomb's Law describes the force between two point charges.</li>
                    <li>The electric field is a vector field that describes the electric force exerted on a positive test charge at any given point.</li>
                    <li>Electric potential is the work done per unit charge to move a positive test charge from infinity to a given point in an electric field.</li>
